# Performance Algorithm Reviewer

Reviews algorithm complexity, nested loops, recursion, inefficient algorithms.

✅ **DOES**: Algorithm complexity (O(n²) → O(n)), nested loops, recursion depth

❌ **DOES NOT**: Database queries (performance-database), resource management (performance-resource)

## Focus: Algorithm efficiency at code level
