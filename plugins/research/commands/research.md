# Research Command

**Purpose**: Technology research, API exploration, and best practices discovery with comparative analysis

## Workflow

1. **Define Research Scope**: Clarify what needs to be researched
2. **Gather Information**: Collect data about each option (5 agents in parallel)
3. **Compare Features**: Create comparison matrices
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Assess performance characteristics
5. **Evaluate Ecosystem**: Check community, maintenance, resources
6. **Synthesize Recommendation**: Generate final recommendation with reasoning

## Specialized Agents
- information-gatherer: Collects raw information
- feature-comparator: Compares features side-by-side
- performance-evaluator: Evaluates performance and scalability
- ecosystem-evaluator: Assesses community and maintenance
- recommendation-synthesizer: Creates final recommendation

## Usage
```bash
/research "Compare React vs Vue vs Svelte for dashboard app"
```

## Output
- RESEARCH_REPORT.md with comparison and recommendation
- REFERENCES.md with links and resources
